# LilLisa Server
## Description

Built using FastAPI, LilLisa Server is an AI question-and-answer program that enables users to ask natural language questions and receive insightful answers based on their personalized data.

LilLisa Server uses LanceDB as the vector database, providing blazingly fast retrieval times and LlamaIndex to handle complex queries.

LilLisa Server is able to grow its knowledge base and get better at answering user questions as more documentation is added and conversations are stored.

Methods free to use are:

**/invoke**

Uses a session ID to retrieve past conversation history. Based on a query, it searches relevant documents in the knowledge base and retrieves multiple fewshot examples from the QA pairs database to help synthesis of a formatted answer. Queries are handled differently and depend on whether an expert is answering or not. ReACT agent handles the use of information given to intellignetly craft an answer.

**/record_endorsement**

Records an endorsemewnt, usually given when an answer is correct, by either a "user" or "expert". This is helpful when admins call the 'get_conversations' method and use it to create more golden QA pairs.
