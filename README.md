# Lil Lisa

Lil Lisa is an application that is responsible for integrating with Slack and handling incoming user events. It acts as a bridge between Slack's platform and the conversational AI experience provided by API calls to a concurrently-running FastAPI application.

# LilLisa Server

Built using FastAPI, LilLisa Server is an AI question-and-answer program that enables users to ask natural language questions and receive insightful answers based on their personalized data.

LilLisa Server uses LanceDB as the vector database, providing blazingly fast retrieval times and LlamaIndex to handle complex queries.

LilLisa Server is able to grow its knowledge base and get better at answering user questions as more documentation is added and conversations are stored.
