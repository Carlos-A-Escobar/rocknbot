# Lil Lisa

Lil Lisa is an application that is responsible for integrating with Slack and handling incoming user events. It acts as a bridge between Slack's platform and the conversational AI experience provided by API calls to a concurrently-running FastAPI application.  

Lil Lisa provides several slash commands for admin use to help improve the knowledge base.
